# MLB-Player-Cards
I wanted to create a webpage that would display statistics like Fangraphs but would have the nice visuals of Baseball Savant. My website uses Pybaseball to obtain both Fangraphs and Baseball Savant data, then it is displayed in a nice card format.

# Roadmap / Coming Soon
* Can search and add whole teams of players
* Can add multiple players with a filter
* Updated standings page
* About page
* MVP Predictor

# Recent Additions
* Pitchers can now be searched
* More batting stats available

Uses Fangraphs and Baseball Savant data through Pybaseball
