# MLB-Player-Cards
I wanted to create a webpage that would display statistics like Fangraphs but would have the nice visuals of Baseball Savant. Here is my take on the idea. My website uses Pybaseball to obtain both Fangraphs and Baseball Savant data, in which it is displayed in nice player cards when a player is searched for. 

# Roadmap / Coming Soon
* More batting statistics to be displayed
* Pitcher statistics to be displayed
* Can search and add whole teams of players
* Can add multiple players with a filter
* Updated standings page
* About page
